# IAM guidelines and best practices

Don't use the root account except for AWS account setup

One physical user = One AWS user (IAM user)

Assign users to groups and assign permissions to groups

Create a strong password policy

Use and enforce the use of Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)

Create and use Roles for giving permissions to AWS services

Use Access Keys for Programatic Access (CLI/SDK)

Audit permissions of your account with the IAM credentials report

NEVER share IAM users & Access keys
